# Powerpoint-Scaffold
Create section headers and blank text slides based on an agenda slide using Automator/AppleScript (Mac)

Facing an empty powerpoint window is very discouraging. Even you manage to come up an agenda with items you want to say, creating the required slides is also a repetative task.

This automator workflow helps you eliminate the troublesome tasks by create the section header slides and blank text slides automatically from the agenda slide (you still need to do you part, think what you want to say!) 

To use it:
  1. Download the workflow to your Services folder at ~/Library/Services/
  2. Open PowerPoint, create a blank new ppt file.
  3. After the title slide, create a blank text slide and write some agenda.
  4. Select all agenda items and copy them.
  5. Find the service (CreateSlidesBasedOnAgenda) at the Powerpoint menu > Services.
  6. Watch the service works for you.
